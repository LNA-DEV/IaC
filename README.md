# Infrastructure

In the repo IaC (Infrastructure as Code) I manage and document my infrastructure with terraform. My main cloud provider is Hetzner. It has a great offering. 🤑  
But its also hosted in Germany and prioritizes environmental aspects.🍃

I am using terraform to create a kubernetes cluster in the Hetzner-Cloud on bare-metal.
